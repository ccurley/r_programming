R Programming Coursera Repository

I'm rubbish with this sort of thing, so if you are thinking of cheating by copying my work, you are in for a 
potentially unpleasant surprise when grading.

I'm not learning this for the express purpose of being a better data scientist, but rather a program and project
manage of data science projects. So, cribbers PROCEED WITH MORE THAN JUST CAUTION.

This repository contains the assignments from the R Programming Coursera class offered through Johns Hopkins.

My hope is that over the course of this class and future classes the horrific initial versions of these functions
will improve into something that will not consume all of the physical memory and cpu cycle time to run.
